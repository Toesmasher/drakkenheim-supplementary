# Drakkenheim Supplementary Materials

## IMPORTANT

This material is *entirely* unofficial, however as it has gained some appreciation on the
Drakkenheim Discord putting it up in a publicly available repository makes sense.

## What is this?

This place will gather all the supplementary material generated for my group, such as artwork,
tokens, battlemaps and the like that we use in our VTT.

If you want to use the material here in your games you are free to do so. We do, however, ask that
you send our artist Zoderian a thank you message over Discord, she can be found on the Drakkenheim
server.

Want to contribute with something that's missing here? Create a pull request, or send me a message
on discord.

## What will not be found here?

Official artwork from the published material will and can not be published here, you'll have to
extract this yourself. If you are a Linux, MacOS or BSD user there is a script available to extract
what I'm hoping is everything you could possibly want from the PDF.

## Missing something?

Create an issue! If you're missing something that isn't unique to your campaign, odds are that so
are we. Alternatively, send me a message on discord at Toesmasher#7318.
